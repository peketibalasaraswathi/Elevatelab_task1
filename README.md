Task 1 – Students Performance Dataset Analysis


# Overview

This project focuses on understanding the Students Performance dataset by analyzing its structure, data types, and suitability for machine learning. The task involves basic data exploration and observation without building any machine learning model.

# Tools Used

Python

Google Colab 

Pandas, NumPy

# Dataset

StudentsPerformance.csv

The dataset contains information about students’ demographics and their scores in math, reading, and writing.

# Steps Followed

Loaded the dataset using Pandas.

Displayed the first and last few rows to understand the structure.

Used info() and describe() to analyze data types and statistics.

Identified numerical and categorical features.

Checked unique values in categorical columns to understand data distribution.

Identified the target variable (math score) for machine learning suitability.

Analyzed dataset size and discussed its suitability for ML tasks.

Checked data quality using isnull() and observed that the dataset has no missing values.
